# Final-project-school
This is my final project in school, which brought me professional qualification

I used Node.js and MondoDB for the project. Also followed the MVC architecture

NOTE: When you open the URL, sometimes you will wait 10-20 seconds to start the app, because of the free domain which i used!

URL of the project -> https://final-project-school.onrender.com/
